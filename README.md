# Exploring-Feature-Transformation-Techniques-for-Titanic-Classification-Binning-and-Beyond


# Aim:
The aim of this code is to demonstrate the use of binarization and binning techniques for feature transformation and its impact on classification accuracy. The code performs classification on the Titanic dataset using a Decision Tree classifier and compares the accuracy scores obtained with and without applying these techniques.


# The code consists of the following sections:
# 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
   - Imports necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and scikit-learn modules.
   - Reads the Titanic dataset from a CSV file, considering only the 'Age', 'Fare', and 'Survived' columns.
   - Removes rows with missing values (NaN) from the dataset.

# 2. Data Splitting:
   - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets using a 80:20 ratio.
   
# 3. Decision Tree Classifier:
   - Creates a Decision Tree classifier (clf) without any feature transformation.
   - Fits the classifier on the training data and predicts the labels for the testing data.
   - Calculates the accuracy score of the classifier on the testing data.
   
# 4. Cross-Validation:
   - Performs 10-fold cross-validation on the original dataset using a Decision Tree classifier.
   - Calculates the average accuracy score obtained from cross-validation.
   
# 5. Binning:
   - Applies binning to the 'Age' and 'Fare' features using quantile-based discretization (KBinsDiscretizer).
   - Creates a new ColumnTransformer (trf) to apply the binning transformation to the training and testing sets.
   - Fits the transformed training data to a new Decision Tree classifier (clf1) and predicts the labels for the transformed testing data.
   - Calculates the accuracy score of the classifier on the transformed testing data.
   
# 6. Cross-Validation with Binning:
   - Performs 10-fold cross-validation on the binned dataset using a Decision Tree classifier.
   - Calculates the average accuracy score obtained from cross-validation.
   
# 7. Binarization:
   - Adds a new feature 'family' to the dataset by summing the 'SibSp' and 'Parch' columns.
   - Removes the 'SibSp' and 'Parch' columns from the dataset.
   - Applies binarization to the 'family' feature using the Binarizer.
   - Creates a new ColumnTransformer (trf) to apply the binarization transformation to the training and testing sets.
   - Fits the transformed training data to a new Decision Tree classifier (cf2) and predicts the labels for the transformed testing data.
   - Calculates the accuracy score of the classifier on the transformed testing data.
   
# 8. Cross-Validation with Binarization:
   - Performs 10-fold cross-validation on the binarized dataset using a Decision Tree classifier.
   - Calculates the average accuracy score obtained from cross-validation.

The code provides a comparison of accuracy scores obtained with and without applying binarization and binning techniques. This analysis helps understand the impact of these feature transformation methods on the classification performance.

# Statement:
1. Decision Tree Classifier (without feature transformation): The accuracy score on the testing data is approximately 0.6364 (63.64%).

2. Cross-Validation (without feature transformation): The average accuracy score obtained from 10-fold cross-validation is approximately 0.6261 (62.61%).

3. Binning Technique: 
   - Decision Tree Classifier (with binning transformation): The accuracy score on the binned testing data is approximately 0.6364 (63.64%).
   - Cross-Validation (with binning transformation): The average accuracy score obtained from 10-fold cross-validation on the binned data is approximately 0.6527 (65.27%).

# Conclusion:
1. The initial Decision Tree Classifier without any feature transformation gives a moderate accuracy score of around 63.64% on the testing data.
2. However, the cross-validation results show that this accuracy score might not be very reliable, as the average accuracy from 10-fold cross-validation is slightly lower at approximately 62.61%.
3. When applying the binning technique to discretize the 'Age' and 'Fare' features, there is no significant improvement in the accuracy scores. The accuracy on the binned testing data remains similar to the initial classifier, around 63.64%.
4. However, the average accuracy score from 10-fold cross-validation on the binned data shows a slight improvement at approximately 65.27%. This suggests that binning might help generalize the model slightly better.
5. Overall, the binning technique does not show a substantial impact on the accuracy scores in this case. It is important to further evaluate and compare different feature transformation techniques and models to identify the most effective approach for this dataset.
